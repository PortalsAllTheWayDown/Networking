Routing protocols can be split into main types:
    -Interior gateway protocols(IGPs)
    -Exterior gateway protocols(EGPs)

Interior gateway protocols are used for routing within an organization
    -All of the IGPs do the same job, which is to advertise routes within an organization and determine the best path or paths.
    -An organization will typically pick one of the IGPs
    -If an organization has multiple IGPs in effect information can be destributed between them. This should generally be avoided if possible.
Exterior gateway protocols are used for routing between organizations over the internet.
The only EGP in use today is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

Interior gateway protocols can be split into two main types:
    -Distance vector routing protocols
        -In distance vector protocols, each router sends its directly connected neighbours a list of all its known networks along with its own distance to each of those networks.
        -Distance vector routing protocols do not advertise the entire network topology.
        -A router only knows its directly connected neighbours and the lists of networks those neighbours have advertised. It doesn't have detailed topology information beyond its directly connected neighbours.
        -Distance vector routing protocols are often called 'Routing by rumour'
            -Sometime RIP: Routing Information Protocol is used.
            -Sometime EIGRP: Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol is used.
    -Link State routing protocols
        -In link state routing protocols each router describes itself and its interfaces to its directly connected neighbours
        -This information is passed unchanged from router to another
        -Every router learns the full picture of the network including every router, its interfaces and what they connect to
            -Sometime OSPF: Open Shortest Path First is used.
            -Sometime IS-IS: Intermediate System - Intermediate System is used.
