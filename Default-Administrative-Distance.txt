Administrative Distance is used to choose between multiple paths learned via different routing protocols.
Metric is used to choose between multiple paths learned via the same protocol
The administrative Distance is considered first to narrow the choise down to the single best routing protocol
The metric is then considered to choose the best paths or paths which make it into the routing table.
