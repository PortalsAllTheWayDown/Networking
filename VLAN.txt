Access Layer:
End hosts such as desktop computer, severs and IP phones connect into the network at the access layer.
It is designed to have a high port count at an affordable cost.
Desktops typically only have one network interface card so they connect into one switch or wireless access point.
Servers will often have dual NICs and connect to a pair of redundant switches
Client access security measures are enabled at the access layer.

Distribution Layer:
Access layer switches uplink to Distribution layer switches.
The Distribution Layer switches serve as an aggregation point for the Access Layer and provide scalability.
Distribution Layer switches are typically deployed in redundant pairs, with downstream Access Layer switches connected to both.
End hosts are not typically connected here.
Most software poilcy such as Qos is enabled at this layer.

Core Layer:
Distribution layer switches uplink to Core Layer switches.
Core Layer switches are typically deployed in redundant pairs, with downstream Distribution Layer switches connected to both.
Traffic between different parts of the campus travels through the core so it is designed for speed and resiliency.
Software policy slows the switch down so should be avoided in the Core Layer.

Router Operations:
Routers operate at layer 3 of the osi stack
Hosts in separate ip subnets must send traffic via a router to communicate
security rules on routers or firewalls can be used to easily control what traffic is allowed between different ip subnets at layer 3
routers do not forward broadcast traffic by default
They provide performance and security by splitting networks into smaller domains at layer 3
